                  <p>Well, an ordinary person would say that. But a person with a higher EQ (emotional intelligence) will instantly get confused. "Why she asks me that, if she don't care at all?" It will be recognized as a manipulation technique, what it indeed is, and instead of opening someone up, you will just close him.</p>

                  <p>Since i am usually struggling from misunderstanding and get rejected "due to non-technical aspects", i learned that it is very energy wasting to put too much effort into this phase. My head is not a place to collect information about companies which are unable to understand my qualities.

That means, if you want precise information, you should provide at least relevant circumstances, or maybe a context. This is necessary to trigger intuition. Please bear in mind, on daily work conditions, there are always enough triggers available, so this was and is never an issue. But HR people are really a nightmare.</p>

You should perform black box validation instead, which is more objective and safe in terms of possible misjudgement, what is also in your own interest. Bear in mind, everyone can say everything.

                  <p>Strengths and weaknesses are relative. You should be more specific.</p>
                  <p>For example, you may think your strength is having good social skills, because you are communicative and always get from people what you want. But i might say it's just manipulative, manipulation is a kind of cheating and cheating is not a skill you should be proud of.<br>For giving a point to a social skill, i would like to sense on which way you achieve your results and how long term are the effects. Does it have any negative sight effects afterwards?
                  </p>
                  <p>I may think i have weak social skills by obviousness cause i am a type of loner, but at the same time i can provide much better understanding to people who are angry or have other specific needs, fix misunderstandings by hitting the root cause directly, and maintain a much healthier and fireproof cooperation structure, always seeking for fields to improve and also predicting coming tragedies before others can even imagine them.</p>

                  <p>It's a little bit rude to expect a serious answer here; even if this question officially has the aim to check self awareness, having self awareness does not mean that someone want to share with you her/his struggles, especially someone who knows that you don't really care about. And here is also a context missing, because weaknesses are relative.</p>
                  <p>When i was young, i learned a surprising defense strategy. If someone wants to hit you, then... help him. If someone blames you for whatever reason, agree and convince him you are even worse. On the next day, you will have absolute piece, because those underdeveloped EQ's thrive from your pain while encouraging you to try a pointless defense. If you don't do it, they instantly loose the interest in you. So as long it's only words, nothing really happened, and besides you get rid of the company of a toxic person. It's a win-win for you, because who you are not depends of how others sees you or even how you describe yourself.</p>
                  <p>I kept this experience as a reflex. If you insist on asking for me weaknesses, the only thing you can get is admitting me i am weak at all. It's not mine problem, but your own if you have that much weaknesses that you can not imagine someone who does not.</p>
                  <p>For a kind of perfectionist, which i am one of them too, admitting a weakness is like giving up on self improvement. If i would seriously admit a weakness of myself in general, it would mean i allow it to be forever a part of me in your eyes, because regardless of whatever i would do with, you would forever remember me with that weakness sticker on my head. This picture makes every further self development attempts pointless, which is probably the reason why people admitting weaknesses rarely get rid of them. Maybe i am not perfect in everything, but how far can i be from if i am always tending to working on it? And about the details, i will definitely not talk about with strangers, except you can be very explicit about the context.<br>But you should not mess this up with a potential inability to admit mistakes. Admitting mistakes, regardless of how painful it may appear, is always an important step in the self improvement process, because it is exactly this pain experience which protects you from falling into the same mistake again. And it is just the right way, regardless of what you have learned during your management classes.

                  <p>If i have to choose between a leading role and a solo role with a comparable salary, i am probably more interested in the solo work. I feel better having a different field of responsibility and tasks than other people around. Which not means that i am inoperable otherwise.</p>
                  <p>I have spend most of my working experience in leading functions, only to tell you that there is nothing interesting what i can tell you about my leading experience. Leading is easy, but very time consuming, and in this time i should learn new skills which should give me more opportunities. But unfortunately, i had to waste my time with leading, which gives me nothing. Even if someone seeks for a leading person, it is impossible for a personality like me to sell that kind of ability to someone who don't have experienced me in action. So i would be glad to not need to waste my time with leading anymore, if it is not directly connected with a superior salary and a capability to create a better work environment.</p>

                  <p>It depends of what topic.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>In general, it is important in every organization that everyone knows what his or her role is at the moment. Some roles are decisive and some not. We can talk about everything with everyone, but it has to be always clear up to whom is it to make the final decision. It's obviously fine to make common decisions but sometimes it is not possible, and this rule &nbsp;is exactly for such a scenario. We can complain and argue about later, but as for now things are moving on. It is a healthy and conflict avoiding mechanism.</p>
                  <p>If my manager has the decisive role, then i have to follow his decision. If i strongly disagree for some important reasons, and there is no way to fulfill his requirements or it just feels wrong, then it is important to put some effort in mutual understanding. If that still fails, well, it really depends what the reason is. But as i am a conflict avoiding person and goals are not that interesting to me than ways, i would rather quit than argue forever. If my manager don't learned how to behave properly during his lifetime, i can not spend another one trying to teach him.</p>

                  <p>It's not because it was not interesting. It is because there are no work possibilities related explicit to physicists. So i end up with the capability do do everything, but no one wants to let me do anything. Which is not really surprising if we know that there are more dedicated graduates available.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Simply saying, the outcome compared to the effort put in is very disappointing. Even being one of the best grade graduates in physics, it is very difficult to get any opportunities.</p>

Let's consider a simple example. What would you feel if i would invite you to disclothe before we continue? Just to be more comfortable and get to know each other better. Well, you may disagree at first buy i would continue arguing that's not a big deal, we are living in the XXI century and do you really think i didn't have seen everything already on redtube? Finally you are probably hiding some compromising tattoos, because there is hard to imagine why else you play so shy and make scenes.</p>

                  <p>I would suggest to perform a kind of black box validation.<br>You do black box validation when you assess the output based on your input. The black box delivers you some results, but you don't care what's going on on a deeper layer inside of the box. This can be performed simulating decision making or problem solving scenarios, or even showing a series of pictures to describe. It's objective, delivers concrete results and suitable for every personality type.
